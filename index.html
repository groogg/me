                    Pizza over beer. Beer makes me run slower, and family
                    mornings can't be compromised. With hot sauce, because
                    ketchup is overrated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    D&D is much better when people are voice-acting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please just use Terraform...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and sadly, it takes me three months to grow a mustache.

                <h2 id="projects">My hobbit journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Studied data science, got a master's, and realized they forgot to teach programming.
                    Decided to learn it myself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joined Ivado Labs in 2020 as a pseudo-data scientist.
                    Worked hard, moved to the official title, and then to science lead.
                    Missed the deterministic nature of software engineering, so I decided I wanted to jump over the fence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worked hard and moved to Team Lead.
                    Now, I can do both and focus on ensuring our teams are happy, growing, and motivated to deliver.
                <p>
                    Happy since.
                </p>
                
                <h2 id="projects">Things I've worked on</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Airline pricing</strong> - 
                    Applied new ML-powered pricing that focused on maximizing revenue and data variability. 
                    Sad to use Azure, and realized how expensive Snowflake was, but good networking challenges.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Retail promotion optimization</strong> - 
                    Optimized the promotional calendar of a catalogue of 2000+ SKUs for the next quarter.
                    The forecasting model was a tough one, but the optimization worked amazingly well.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Agricultural precision forecasting</strong> - 
                    Reduced the required number of on-field sensors to predict in-canopy conditions by combining forecasting and sensor data.
                    Now, I know too much about how larvae evolve to eat your leaves. Working with satellite imagery was a great check on my bucket list.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Fortunate to say I have 10 others like that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tired of Python, really want to dabble into Go or Rust, maybe Zig.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Trying hard to break my years of muscle memory to learn Vim. Feel like I am missing something.
