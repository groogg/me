                    Pizza over beer. Beer makes me run slower, and family
                    mornings can't be compromised. With hot sauce, because
                    ketchup is overrated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    D&D is much better when people are voice-acting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please use Terraform...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and blueberries can give you a sugar rush.

                <h2 id="projects">My hobbit journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Studied data science, got a master's, and realized they forgot to teach programming.
                    Decided to learn it myself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joined Ivado Labs in 2020 as a pseudo-data scientist.
                    Worked hard, moved to the official title, and then to science lead.
                    Missed the deterministic nature of software engineering, so I decided I wanted to jump over the fence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worked hard and moved to Team Lead.
                    Now, I can do both and focus on ensuring our teams are happy, growing, and motivated to deliver.
                <p>
                    Happy since.
                </p>
                
                <h2 id="projects">Things I've worked on</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Airline pricing</strong> - 
                    Applied new ML-powered pricing that focused on maximizing revenue and data variability. 
                    Sad to use Azure, and realized how expensive Snowflake was, but good networking challenges.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Retail promotion optimization</strong> - 
                    Optimized the promotional calendar of a catalogue of 2000+ SKUs for the next quarter.
                    The forecasting model was challenging, but the optimization worked remarkably well.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Agricultural precision forecasting</strong> - 
                    Reduced the required number of on-field sensors to predict in-canopy conditions by combining forecasting and sensor data.
                    Now, I know too much about how larvae evolve to eat your leaves. Working with satellite imagery was a great check on my bucket list.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Luckily, I’ve got 10+ others just like that.
                </p>

                <h2 id='interest'>Current stack</h2>

                <p>
                    Pythonista through & through! Not the fastest, but the go-to for AI-driven solutions. 
                    I’ve always wanted to explore compiled, statically typed languages, but haven’t had the chance yet.
                    Always on the lookout for new technologies, ONLY IF they really make things simpler.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Not rigid on the stack—cloud, on-prem, monolith, or distributed.
                    I just care about elegance, simplicity, and solving the problem at hand.
                </p>
